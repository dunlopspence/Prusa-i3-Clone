## Why?
Challenge myself to modify existing open source designs to fit the parts I had at hand. The Prusa MK3 is a great printer to build as most parts can be 3d printed. 

## Machined Parts
The frame of the printer was cut using a template found online.The base for the moving print bed was CNC machined out of delrin to be strong and rigid. This is shown below:

## Modification
The TAZ 5 and MK3 use different sized linear rods and leadscrews. Because of this, I needed to modify some of the 3d printed parts. These can be found in the parts folder.

## Challenges faced
Although the project was very sucessfull, I did have a few challenges to overcome

1) Lead screws for the TAZ 5 were too large to incorporate into the design. Lead screws for the MK3 had to be purchased.
2) Wood frame was soft and effected orthogonality of the printer.
3) A lot of debugging/tinkering of the marlin firmware was done to allow the printer to pass the startup checklist.

Overall, I was able to use the printer to help with my fourth year capstone project and saved money by building it myself. In the future I hope to laser cut all the frame pieces to fix the orthogonality as that is a key component in accurate printing.
